      <h1>How WorldLand works</h1>
      <p>Participating nodes play crucial roles in the WorldLand ecosystem:</p>
      <br />
      <li>Collecting transactions: Nodes gather transactions to create blocks on the blockchain.</li>
      <li>
        Verifying blocks: Nodes verify the blocks created by other nodes to prevent double-spending and ensure the
        integrity of the blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Channeling energy: Nodes contribute a certain amount of energy to the blockchain, enhancing the network's
        resistance against attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Computing resources: Nodes provide computing resources such as CPU, GPU, storage space, and internet
        connectivity. These resources are utilized for tasks like zero-knowledge proof computations and participation in
        cloud services required for My AI Agent learning and reasoning services.
      </li>
      <br />
      <p>
        WorldLand incentivizes and empowers participating nodes to contribute to the network's consensus algorithm while
        providing valuable services and resources, creating a decentralized and secure ecosystem.
