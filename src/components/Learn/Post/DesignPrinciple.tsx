      <h1>Design principles</h1>
      <p>
        The WorldLand platform is designed with simplicity, decentralization, and security as its core principles. It
        aims to address the issues of re-centralization and scalability without compromising on decentralization or
        security. This means that the platform avoids reducing the number of participating nodes or adopting algorithms
        that require excessive inter-node communication.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Features of the WorldLand Platform: </p>
      <br />
      <li>Green VCA (formerly ECCPoW) based entities are organized into multiple layers.</li>
      <li>
        It enables the implementation of various functions and roles by connecting blockchains with different purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, the platform cannot be supported as a single-chain solution and requires ecosystem evolution through
        natural consumer selection.
      </li>
      <br />
      <h3>Key Performance Indicators</h3>
      <br />
      <p>The Green VCA Matrix is evaluated based on the following key performance metrics: </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>M1. PQ Secure Encryption and Consensus</li>
        <li>M2. Energy Consumption Efficiency (ECE)</li>
        <li>M3. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (1/2)</li>
        <li>M4. Unchangeable Currency Issuance Schedule</li>
        <li>M5. Block Creation Time (average 10 seconds)</li>
        <li>M6. Block Size (1 Mbyte)</li>
      </ul>
    </>
