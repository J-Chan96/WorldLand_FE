      <h1>Maintaining Network Decentralization Against ASIC Devices</h1>
      <p>
        The conventional Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems are facing issues related to decentralization, particularly due to
        the use of expensive ASIC devices. By utilizing Error Correction Code-based PoW, WorldLand mitigates the
        influence of these costly ASIC devices within the network. The Error Correction Code-based PoW consensus
        algorithm generates mining puzzles that vary with time, thereby diminishing the efficiency of ASIC devices. The
        implementation of error correction codes ensures fair participation in the consensus process, preventing ASICs
        from monopolizing mining activities. This approach aids miners in maintaining decentralization and equal
        opportunities.
